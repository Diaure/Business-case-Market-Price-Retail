* Perform data-driven analysis<br>

## **Context** <br>
You are a data analyst for a great retail company. Sales service has a lot of data about costs and benefits around the world.
They need to explore and focus on a specific and juicy market (because they have a rise in benefits). They also have feedback about customers you need to process. Your aim is to explore, present and target a market.<br>

## **Business problem**<br>
What can the company do to **`reduce costs and increase benefits`**?

## **Database content**<br>
The dataset is composed of 8047 customers, with city and region. Also, for each, you have the segment matching (Home Office, Consumer, Corporate), the category, and sub-category (Paper, Art, copiers, etc.). For each product, you have the name, the discount, the sales, the profit, and the quantity.<br>
